  <noscript>Hi there! Just letting you know that while this site should work perfectly fine without JS, some portions of it may be broken. In that case, you'll see these messages with non-interactive alternatives. (though if you're still using the internet with no JS, i applaud you)</noscript>
  <p>ByeCorps publishes and develops games and tools aimed at live streamers, and is currently working on:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://raibu.live">raibu.live</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://deathbyhamster.com">Death By Hamster</a></li>
  </ul>
  <p class="center"><small>(oh, and while this site does look pretty because CSS, it works pretty well in older browsers too! Seriously, it looks like <strong>a website</strong> in IE5.)</small></p>
